         Subsystem providing access to a mobile LTE network

This package deploys the usb_net_drv, mbimcli and nic_router components
among other utility components. It serves as a standalone variant for providing
network access via a supported USB LTE modem.

The mbimcli component reads its config from the provided file system. A
'mbimcli.config' file is created with default content in the file system, if it
does not exist. You need to adapt (or remove) the apn, username, password and
pin attributes accordingly to be able to register to the mobile network of your
provider.

After successful connection, the mbimcli component creates a config for the
package-internal nic_router. By default, this config advises the nic_router
to provide a default domain as a 'Nic' server and to provide another domain
as a 'Nic' client. The latter allows a cascaded setup with Sculpt's central
nic_router. Both domains will be forwarded and NATed to the usb_net_drv.

The package-internal nic_router operates a DHCP server on both domains. The
interface's IP address of the default domain and the address range for the DHCP
is configurable in 'mbimcli.config', e.g.:

!<config>
!  <default-domain interface="10.0.3.1/24" ip_first="10.0.3.2" ip_last="10.0.3.200"/>
!</config>

In the default configuration, there are two options for connecting application
components to the mobile network. Firstly, you can re-route their
'Nic' requirement to the mobile_network component, in which case they are
mapped to the default domain. Secondly, you can keep the application component
connected to the central nic_router instance and change the router's config as
follows:

!<default-policy domain="default"/>
!<policy label_prefix="mobile_network -> " domain="mobile_uplink"/>
!<domain name="mobile_uplink">
!  <nat domain="default" tcp-ports="1000" udp-ports="1000" icmp-ids="1000"/>
!</domain>
!<domain name="default" interface="10.0.1.1/24">
!  <dhcp-server ip_first="10.0.1.2" ip_last="10.0.1.200" dns_server_from="mobile_uplink"/>
!  <tcp dst="0.0.0.0/0">
!    <permit-any domain="mobile_uplink"/>
!  </tcp>
!  <udp>
!    <permit-any domain="mobile_uplink"/>
!  </udp>
!  <icmp dst="0.0.0.0/0" domain="mobile_uplink"/>
!</domain>

This indicates the nic_router to assign the session request from the mobile_network
component to the mobile_uplink domain.
Furthermore, TCP, UDP and ICMP packets are forwarded from the default domain to
the mobile_uplink domain where they are NATed.

Note, that this config is compatible with an already existing uplink domain
(e.g. from a 'nic_drv' or 'wifi_drv'). You can easily switch the router's
internal routing by changing the 'domain' attributes in the default domain.
